README for AdaEncoder

Note that you MUST connect the two pins for your rotary encoder to 2 pins on the same PORT
on the ATmega chip. If you do not, your sketch will simply reset. I should probably remove
this restriction one day.

ALWAYS make sure you are using the latest version of the ooPinChangeInt library. Check this
page for the latest version and status:

These are the PORTs on the ATmega328:
 * Arduino Pins     PORT
 * ------------     ----
 * Digital 0-7      D
 * Digital 8-13     B
 * Analog  0-5      C   (== digital pins 14-19)

ATMEGA2560 Pin Change Interrupts, pins and PORTs:

    Arduino              Arduino              Arduino
      Pin*  PORT PCINT     Pin   PORT PCINT     Pin   PORT PCINT
      A8     PK0  16       10     PB4   4       SS     PB0   0
      A9     PK1  17       11     PB5   5       SCK    PB1   1
     A10     PK2  18       12     PB6   6       MOSI   PB2   2
     A11     PK3  19       13     PB7   7     MISO   PB3   3
     A12     PK4  20       14     PJ1  10
     A13     PK5  21       15     PJ0   9
     A14     PK6  22        0     PE0   8 - this one is a little odd.*
     A15     PK7  23

* Note: Arduino Pin 0 is PE0 (PCINT8), which is RX0. Also, it is the only other
pin on another port on PCI1. Therefore, this pin is not supported by this library.
