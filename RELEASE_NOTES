 AdaEncoder.h - A library for reading Lady Ada's or Sparkfun's rotary encoder.
 Should work for any rotary encoder with 2 pins (4 states).

Version 0.7 Tue Nov 20 17:56:29 CST 2012
Now works with the latest ooPinChangeInt. Should be much more reliable.

Bugfixes: the clicks variable was supposed to be int8_t, but I had query() and getClicks() returning uint8_t types.

Updated to utilize the ByteBuffer to fill a buffer of text for debug purposes.

turnOffPWM has been moved into its own file, as that code is distributed under the LPGL license. I use the GPL.

 Version 0.5 Wed Feb 29 07:30:23 CST 2012
	Shipped without PinChangeInt, so we don't stomp on PinChangeInt if the user has both libraries.
	Includes the LIBCALL_PINCHANGEINT macro for work with PinChangeInt v1.70beta (and newer).
	Cleaned up some of the #includes.
	Included a copy of the gpl in the zip file, like a good citizen.  The file is gpl.txt.
 Version 0.4 Sun Oct  9 12:09:17 CDT 2011
    Includes cppfix.h, so that we can use the new() operator with PinChangeInt-0.3 (and above).
 Version 0.3 Thu Sep 22 20:11:31 CDT 2011
 	Updated to save the old value of the SREG prior to cli().
